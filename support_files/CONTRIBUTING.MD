# How to contribute

## Testing

To run tests, use `npm run test` or `npm run test:w` for watch mode. This lets you run tests while you code.

## Debugging

You can debug the application using your [Firefox browser](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/#test-and-debug). To compile the code as you debug, it is helpful to build development files in watch mode with `npm run build:w`.

## Pull Request

Before making a pull request, make sure to rebuild the dist files with `npm run build`.
